# StepMotorARDUINO-UNO
This is an Arduino program that controls a motor and two LEDs. The program uses an LCD screen and Serial communication to interact with the user. The user can choose to rotate the motor in either clockwise or counter-clockwise direction by sending the corresponding value (1 or 2) via the Serial communication. The program sets the direction of the motor and corresponding LED by changing the state of the pins connected to them. The LCD screen displays the chosen direction of the motor. The program continuously checks for new values from the Serial communication in the loop function.
